## My Favorite Television Show: Breaking Bad

I love **Breaking Bad** because of its **intense storytelling** and complex characters. The show masterfully blends suspense, drama, and moral dilemmas, making every episode captivating. The transformation of Walter White from a humble teacher to a notorious figure is both shocking and fascinating.
