## Favorite Outdoor Activity: Hiking

Hiking lets me disconnect from screens and reconnect with the natural rhythm of the outdoors. I enjoy the steady climb, the changing terrain, and the quiet moments where only wind and distant bird calls break the silence. It keeps me physically strong while clearing mental clutterâ€”each trail feels like a mini reset that balances challenge and calm.

### Why It Matters To Me
- Builds endurance and resilience
- Encourages presence and mindfulness
- Offers scenic rewards that photos rarely capture
